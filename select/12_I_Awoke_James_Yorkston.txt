Did you lay with the shallow girl?
Did you wake with her warmth by her side?
What are these tales that are reaching my ears?
Yes, I awoke and I awoke by her side
Yes, I awoke and I awoke by her side

Were you close, were you lovers, were friends?
Did she play with and blacken my good name?
Did she cry out and reel you in?
Yes she cried out and I shall never feel the same
Yes she cried out and I shall never feel the same

Could you want her?
Could you need her more than I
More than I?

And of love you swore un-blinding
Of the strength that you promised me
Dare I hope dare pray dare I ask

When you awoke, did you think of me?
When you awoke, did you think of me?

Could you want her, could you need her
More than I, more than?
Could you want her, could you need her
More than I, more than?
