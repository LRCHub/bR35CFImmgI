When I awoke,
the summer's all around.
Sweet music played,
the kaleidoscope of sound.

Fly away with your dream up in the sky,
never asking why you're there.
When you return,
I wander to my door.

I am the light you remember.

Fly away with your dream up in the sky,
never asking why you're there.
When you return,
I wander to my door.

I am the light you remember.
