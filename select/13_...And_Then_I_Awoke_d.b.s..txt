What's the colour of pretty?
December whispers with her whiskers and purrs.
It's the way the sun hits your wall.
Don't worry your pretty little head today.
In two's into June, can I come in, too?
Did you hear my favorite bird sing?
I sing songs to the sun icing this long winter over.
April's coming early.
