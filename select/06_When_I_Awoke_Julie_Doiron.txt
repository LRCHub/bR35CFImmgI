When I awoke you were long gone
(X4)

You touched my hand
You were awake
And while you slept
You dreamed of all the other hands you held
And wondered why you stayed around
With all the other hands to be held

And in a note, you said it all
And you were gone, when I awoke

You touched my hand
You were awake
And while you slept
You dreamed of all the other hands you held
And wondered why you stayed around
With all the other hands to be held

When I awoke you were long gone
(X4)
