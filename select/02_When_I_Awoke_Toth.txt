You looked like a shadow of the day before
Your face contained a hungry wind and chance of rain
Overnight a change in travel plans you're on your way

When I awoke
When I awoke
When I awoke

You step into my stream about a thousand times a day

When I awoke
Open Up your eyes (When I awoke)
Open up your eyes (When I awoke)
