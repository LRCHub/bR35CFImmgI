Shelf life:
You've almost passed.
Your sell by date is today.
Spread your legs and find a,
Way to pay.

I jumped out of a,
Plane to clear my mind and regain,
A place to store an-
Ger for when you left me father.
In freefall we discussed,
Thoughts unexposed to others.
Thank you for your time, Dad.
Point made now we are stronger.

Why'd you have to operate?
Oh-oh.
I can see your bones
Why'd you have to operate?
Oh-oh.
I can see your bones
Why'd you have to operate?
Oh-oh.
I can see your bones

I can tell your lacking a smile.
It's time to look back,
And reminisce that.
Our watches tick-tock.
Mistaken seisures clip wrists.
Suck and pull strings.
Snip and dig deep for...

Do we have to make it?
(You refresh the idea with overdubs)
Love is just a question.
(It involves me, you, and us, and everyone)
She believes that we're here.
(Yes, and no commit involved to let us out)
Or perhaps we're good as done?

Shelf life:

You're,
Better off in past tense,
Of a wide wrist.
Clowns will search for time and,
Ways to pay.

Do we have to make it?
You refresh the idea with overdubs.
Love is just a question.
It involves me, you, and us, and everyone.
Gravitate the answer.
Yes, and no commit involved to let us out.|
Separate devotion.
Fingers striped and cracked in time to roll a dime.

Do we have to make it?

Love is just a question.
